<u>**Aim 1**</u> :  WAP to abstract some attributes of class Admin to prevent them to be inherited by its child classes.

                    - Class Admin -> Class Manager
                    - Class Manager -> Class Employee
                    - Class Admin has following members:
                    - company_name
                    - manager_salary
                    - employee_salary
                    - total_staff
                    - total_annual_revenue
                    - can_terminate
                    - use all attributes accessibility in parent class and child class properly.
                    - override a method myAccess() in both child classes to display all parent classâ€™s members value accordingly.
